        <h2 class="two ">What does Meraki mean?</h2>
        <h3>This is a word that modern Greeks often use to desribe doing something with soul, creativity or love - when you put "something of yourself " into what you're doing, whatever it may be.</h3>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="three ">What is Mandala?</h2>
        <h3>Mandala is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe. The circular designs symbolizes the idea that life is never ending and everything is connected. The mandala also represents spiritual journey within
            the individual viewer. The first level is understanding the unity in cosmos and the second level is that each individual must find their own place within it. Mandala designs are meant to remove irritating thoughts and allow the creative mind
            to run free as well as relaxation. But ultimately people create and look at mandalas to centre the body and mind.</h3>
        <h2 class="four ">So what you waiting for? Grab the art work that you love!!</h2>
